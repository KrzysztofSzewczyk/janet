Janet is a dynamic, lightweight programming language with strong functional
capabilities as well as support for imperative programming. It to be used
for short lived scripts as well as for building real programs. It can also
be extended with native code (C modules) for better performance and interfacing with
existing software. Janet takes ideas from Lua, Scheme, Racket, Clojure, Smalltalk, Erlang, Arc, and 
a whole bunch of other dynamic languages.
